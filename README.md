# ChromeExtension

Chrome extension:
A chrome extension needs to be built that does the following:
When a webpage loads, if the title or meta description (see note at the bottom) has the word
‘videos’, redirect the webpage to ‘https://www.google.com’

Note:
1. Title of a page has the html tag <title>
2. Meta description of a page has the html tag <meta name=”description”>


Your extension should redirect the following URLs (test cases) as they have the word ‘videos’:
1. Youtube.com
2. Vimeo.com
3. Viralvideos.com
4. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most-viewed_YouTube_videos
